# 📊 The "Official" Story 

Before we can understand the true depth of America's urban livability crisis, we must first examine what the official statistics tell us. This dashboard presents the baseline facts as reported by government sources and official economic indicators: federal and state minimum wage data, official cost-of-living statistics, and the numbers that policymakers and official sources cite when discussing wages and living costs across America's largest cities. Here, we establish the foundation of the "official story"—the data that shapes public policy debates and forms the starting point for understanding the gap between what workers earn and what they need to survive. These visualizations reveal the surface-level picture that will be deconstructed in the dashboards that follow, showing us not just what the numbers say, but setting the stage for understanding why they often fail to capture the full reality of working-class life in urban America.

This visualization tracks the evolution of minimum wage policies across all 50 states and U.S. territories over the past two decades, comparing state-level minimum wages against the federal baseline. The data reveals a clear upward trajectory: both federal and state minimum wages have steadily increased since 2000, with the federal minimum wage rising from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour, while many states have implemented even more aggressive increases. Notably, over half of all states now maintain minimum wage rates that exceed the federal standard—a trend that has accelerated in recent years. On the surface, these numbers tell a story of progress and improved worker welfare, suggesting that policymakers are recognizing the need to ensure workers can earn a living wage. But are they? While these official statistics show wages rising, they tell us nothing about whether these increases have kept pace with the actual cost of living in America's urban centers. The numbers look promising in isolation, but they represent only one side of the equation—what workers earn, not what they need to survive.

While minimum wage trends show upward movement, understanding the true cost burden requires examining how essential expenses are distributed across different categories. The following visualization breaks down the total cost of living by state, revealing which factors—housing, healthcare, food, transportation, and childcare—contribute most significantly to the financial burden workers face.

## Cost of Living Breakdown

This stacked bar chart reveals the composition of living costs across all 50 states, breaking down total expenses into five essential categories: housing, healthcare, food, transportation, and childcare. Each state's bar represents its total cost of living, with the colored segments showing the proportional contribution of each expense category. The visualization makes immediately clear that housing costs dominate the financial burden in most states, often comprising the largest segment of the bar, followed by healthcare and food costs. Transportation and childcare expenses, while significant, typically represent smaller but still substantial portions of the total. What becomes apparent is not just the absolute dollar amounts—which vary dramatically from state to state—but the structural composition of these costs: even in states with lower total expenses, the same fundamental categories consume workers' incomes, just at different scales. This breakdown sets the stage for understanding why minimum wage increases, while positive on paper, may still fall short when confronted with the multi-faceted reality of essential living expenses.
