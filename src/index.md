# The Urban Livability Index Gap: Visualizing the Invisible Cost Burden on the United States' Working Class

Across the United States, the **working class** has seen a growing disconnect between livable wages and the cost of necessities. This paper will also build on the assumption, and the perspective, that the working class has also seen a stark divide in the government's views and response to this income disparity issue.

National headlines cite figures such as "needing at least $160,000 to live decently in San Francisco and New York City"—and that's only representing the elite percent of individuals. At the same time, the **federal minimum wage** (after taxes) remains severely below any reasonable, modern measure of a **livable wage**. Cost-of-living factors have long outgrown and evolved beyond the **poverty line** drawn in 1963. This crisis is compounded by inflation, companies shrinking offerings at similar prices (shrinkflation), and real minimum wage values stagnating. Yet there is a lack of government initiative to keep pace with the alarming indicators showing the working class struggling to live in America. This makes it essential to understand the structural gap between livable income and working-class cost-of-living calculations to propose remedial measures without significant economic side effects.

This project quantifies and visualizes the **Urban Livability Gap**: the difference between a worker's take-home income (at minimum wage) and the essential cost of living in major cities, revealing not only where this gap is largest, but also why it persists—highlighting the consequential role of government policy and wage-setting at both state and federal levels.

## The Problem

Gaps in urban livability are challenging to measure without precise, comparative data. This paper will address three issues: how **macroeconomic factors** affect the livability gap, how **microeconomic expenses** further strain the cost of living, and how **recalculated standards** can reveal alarming truths about the average American's economic state.

First, this paper will seek to determine the gap between livable income and the real cost of living across macroeconomic buckets–the federal and state minimum wages, differences in rural vs densely populated areas, and significant **social determinants** (race, gender, geopolitical region)–to visualize more accurate statistics. A key question to analyze here is: How does this livability gap vary across state policies, occupational differences, and at large?

Next, this paper will break down the individual contributors to an American's spending (costs of food, transportation, healthcare, and taxes) and identify which impose the most significant burdens (which will later be imperative to reform and awareness). The visualizations will walk through a compelling story of the breakdown of the cost of living and the alarming trends relative to real income.

Lastly, this paper will break down various perspectives on a more accurate, modern measurement of the livability gap. We, as the writers, seek answers to a modern, economically sound standard of livability. We considered whether it would leave any room for **disposable income** and **financial independence**, or if it would continue to leave the working class in persistent deficits, shaping not only personal financial health but also broader social outcomes. We also hope to provide larger recommendations through compelling visualizations on reform for the working class.


## Stakeholders

The primary audience for this project is **labor advocates** (and adjacent non-profit organizations) and **policymakers** alike. The project is broken down in a digestible manner, with minimal information for the public viewer to understand, while incorporating elements that provide a complex story for economically educated viewers.

Largely, and unfortunately optimistically, this project aims to get in front of **legislative institutions** to bring about reform on a topic that will largely shape the future of America. By making the Urban Livability Gap tangible, accessible, and specific to their jurisdictions, we give these decision-makers the evidence and arguments needed to justify legislative action, design more equitable **social policy**, and address **systemic urban inequality** at scale. This intentional alignment ensures our project not only diagnoses problems but also catalyzes solutions at every level, leaving very little room for speculation or doubt around the story this paper tells.
